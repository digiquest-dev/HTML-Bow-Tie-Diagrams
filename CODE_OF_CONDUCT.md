# Contributor Code of Conduct

All contributors are expected to be respectful and professional.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and inclusive community, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project a respectful and harassment-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback
- Acknowledging the work and contributions of others
- Be mindful that if you are an expert but other contributors are just starting. 

Examples of unacceptable behaviour:
- Insults or derogatory comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Please be mindful that phrases that are inocuous in one language can be inappropriate in others. This includes English language variations.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying acceptable behaviour and are expected to take appropriate action in response to any instances of unacceptable behaviour.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive or unacceptable behaviour may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the repository owner directly via GitHub or email.
